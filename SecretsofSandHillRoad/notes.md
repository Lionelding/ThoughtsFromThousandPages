1. The amount of capital required to start a company began to decline

1. The advent of an incubator knowns as Y Combinator. Knowledge and view sharing across entrepreneurs, change the balance between entrepreneurs and VCs.  


Tech startups need to fit a market problem to a compelling market solution to have a shot at success.

# Chapter 2: So Really, What is Venture Capital

1. VS is a source of funding for companies that are not otherwise good candidates to get funding from other, more traditional financial institutions. 

1. A company that is generating excess cash flow may wish to return capital to its equity holders in the form of a dividend or a buyback of shares, but they are no requirements to do this. 

1. Equity financing VS Debt 

    It is the equity financing that investors are willing to hold on for a long time. If you can generate near-term cash flow, banking lending may be better. No need to sell any of the equity in a company. If no 1) near-term ability to generate cash, 2) risky 3) long illiquidity,  then equity financing is better. 


1. Angel & Seed investors
Convertible notes, in lieu of getting the principal back, the investor converts its debt into equity.
