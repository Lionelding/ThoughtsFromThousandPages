# Chapter 7: Raising Money from a VC
* **Keynotes**:
    * How much and at what evaluation?
    * Everything starts and ends with market size.
    * Make sure you understand the core strategy of your potential partner up front. 
    * Scarcity is the mother of invention. 

1. To support a public market company with a capitalization of several billion dollars in 2019
    A profitable, high-growth, several-hundred-million-dollar-revenue business over a seven-to-ten-year period

1. How much to raise?
    * As much as money as you can that enables you to safely achieve the key milestones you will for the next fund-raising.
    * Think about the next round of financing when you are raising the current round of financing. 
    * In general, raise new capital every 12 to 24 months.
    * Having too much may distract the primary project in your company

1. Milestones for fund raising
    * The Series B investors want at least that the initial version of the product is built. It needs to be commercially available, instead of a beta version.
    * Customer engagement, and contracts. People are willing to pay for the products. Contracts worth of 3-5 millions.

1. At What evaluation?
    * The current round of financing should be driven by the milestones needed to achieve the next round of financing at a higher valuation that reflects the progress of the business.
    * The evaluation needs to reflect the actual progress of business. 
    * A common mistake is to make too small an amount of money at an aggressive evaluation. 
    * Competition drives valuation. 

1. Lessons learned
    * Employees judge the success of the business based on external measure of the valuation in a financing round. 
    * Enough the valuation looks good, the employees may still compare it with other companies.
    * Never understand the value of maintaining momentum in the financial rounds. 

# Chapter 8: The Art of Pitch
* **Keynotes**:
    * CEO sleeps like a baby every night -- waking up every few hours crying. 
    * First principal: How do I convince a VC that my business has a chance to be one of those outsize winners that make her look like a hero in front of her LPs. 

1. How to reach for a VC
    * Angel or seed investors
    * Law firms
    * Your ability to find a warm introduction to VC, is often a screening heuristic that VCs use a gauge on your grit, creativity and determination. 

1. Pitch Essential
    * Convince a VC that your company has the potential to be one of the outliers. 
    1) Market sizing. So what? Start with the logical thinking, but don't stop there. As an entrepreneur, your job is to fit yourself into a market and explain what macro trends are evolving in that market that creates an opportunity for you to own it. Also, position the creation of a market that develops as a result of new technology. 

    2) Team. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is what sets the winners apart from the pretenders. Relate your prior accomplishments and experience to the current business. Don't be shy to talk about your failures. Storytelling skill is a good indicator of potential success in an entrepreneur. Great CEOs find a way to paint a vision for the opportunity that simply makes people want to be a part of company-building process. 

    3) Product. VC evaluate the process by which you came to your initial plan. Strong belief, weakly held: Adapt your plan to the changing market demands, but remain informed by your depth of product development experience. 

    4) Go-to-market. How to acquire customers? 

        Walking VCc through your go-to-market strategy is a great way to show them how your mind works and how deeply you understand your audience. Strong opinions, weakly held. Some set of pivots/tweaks/restart is expected. You need to demonstrate that you are the master of the domain, and every important detail is considered. 
    
        A thoughtful, engaged discussion on how you came to the conclusions that you did and willingness to listen to the feedback and incorporate it into your thinking, would be a far better response than pivoting on the fly. 

    5) Planning for the Next Round of Fund-raising. Clearly articulate the milestones you intend to accomplish with the money you are raising at this round. Aim a valuation that is roughly double your prior round. An existing VC does not want to be the only capital provider at the next round of financing. 

# Chapter 9: Term sheets: Economics
* **Keynotes**:
    * Term sheet is where information asymmetry between VCs and founders comes into play the most, and often at the expense of the founder. 

1. Security: Preferred Shares

1. Aggregate Proceeds
    * This refers to the amount of money invested by the VC.
    * Notes/debts are generally senior to equity. 
    * Convertible notes/debt: 
        The debt converts into equity as the same price at which Series A investor purchase equity. This is `uncapped` note, meaning that valuation at which the note converts is not restricted and will be determined based upon the Series A equity price. In contrast, `Capped` notes establish a ceiling on the maximum price at which the debt will convert into equity. 

        `conversion discount`. A percentage discount for conversion.

        Why to have this? A standard convertible debt documents are pretty simple and don't require much legal time and expense. This allow entrepreneur and seed investor to punt on the question of valuation at this early stage of the company development. 

        Be careful: Don't make too much convertible debt in the early days of the company. Convertible debt financing can often have multiple rolling closings. For example, an entrepreneur over time raised 2-3 million on the same financial terms on which she set out originally to raise 1 million. At series A, she may need to sell much more of equity than she anticipated because of a series of these convertible notes. 

        Be mindful of the trade-off between raising the capitals and minimizing the dilution to your team. 

1. Price per Share
    * `post-money` the valuation of the company once the VC has invested her money.
    * `pre-money` before the investment.
    * Two important elements

        First, any shares that convert as a result of prior convertible debt have to be included in this valuation. 

        Second, valuation also includes the employee option pool. 

    * In order to avoid any additional dilution shares issued for the note conversions and employee option pool, the VC hardcodes the post-money valuation at a fixed amount. 

    > Comparable Company Analysis. This is hard to applied to a startup company because the ability to forecast revenue is inherently unpredictable. 

    > Discounted Cash Flow Analysis: The value of a company equals the present value of its future cash flows. Hard to apply too because most of the value in a discounted cash flow model will come from far-out years. 

    > Both analysis that don't count for the share dilution. 

    * If a firm is early in its life cycle, it probably has the ability to reserve additional dollars to participate in the subsequent rounds of financing for your company. If it is later in the fund life and thus the firm needs to start thinking more about distributing cash back to its LPs, it may be less willing to set aside reserves.

    * The new investors will want to see the earlier investors still have faith in you and they are willing to demonstrate that by putting new, additional capital at risk. 


1. VC Valuation
    * What do I need to believe analysis?
    * What would have to go right with the business for that to happen?
    * Is that possible to have a return of 10 times when the company is sold later?

1. Capitalization
    * VC wants to avoid creation of the option pool to dilute its ownership after investment.
    * An option pool is created before investment. VC often asks the CEO to generate head-count growth plan for the next 12-18 months. So the total number of shares in the option pool can be estimated and be fixed.
    * The CEO would like to keep the pool size as low as possible because increasing the pool size before the current financing round dilutes her. 
    * The VC wants to make the pool size as large as possible because her shares would be diluted if the company needs to increase the pool after the round. 

1. Dividends

    No dividends.


1. Liquidation Preference

    * A fancy way to say who gets their money back under certain circumstances.

    * `1x`. `1x`: VC would be entitled to that multiple of its original investment off tye otp of any sale proceeds. It is usually `1x` for early investors. In contrast, VCs at a later stages may demand more than 1x preference. Investors at different stages of financing may have different economic incentives while selling a company. 

    * `nonparticipating`. Either take her liquidation preference off the top OR convert her preferred shares into common shares and take the equity value of her percentage ownership of the company. `participating` is the opposite. Not only a VC gets the liquidation preference first, but then she also gets to convert her shares into common and participate in any leftover proceeds as with any other shareholders. This is pretty unusual. 

    * `seniority`: someone has a preference to the liquidation proceeds ahead of the other preferred holders. `pari passu` is the opposite. Every preferred holders are treated equally. `Seniority` is introduced when there are at least two classes of stocks. This actually matters because it creates different economic incentives for your investors.

1. Redemption
    * Usually, no redemption. 
    * If they exist, are likely to come into play at the worst time for the company. 


1. Conversion/Auto-Conversion

    * Convert a preferred share to a common share. 
    * Why: To make a company public, you will want to clean up the capital structure of the company by having everyone convert to common shares. 

    * Most companies sell between 10 and 20 percent of the company at an IPO.

    * One Auto-convert is to put in a place a specific per-share price or a return on investment threshold to force conversion. 

    * voluntary conversion. a majority of the preferred stock to vote. This is usually done if the company is in bad situation. If restart the company is one solution, it is better to clean up the capitalization table by getting rid of some or all of that liquidation preferences. 

    * The Capital P in `Preferred Stock`. No matter how many different classes of preferred stock may exist over the life of the company, they all vote together as a single group in determining whether a majority of them wants to voluntarily convert into common. 

    * Once you set the precedent of giving individual series of preferred stock their own votes, it is very hard to take it back. 


1. Antidilution Provisions
    * Hope is not a strategy, better to be safe than sorry. 
    * `Down round`: next valuation of the current round is lower than the previous round. 

        `Down round` is painful.

        Lower price means that more shares need to be issued to raise a fixed amount of capital than if the price were higher.

        Value of your ownership position in the company would be lower. 

        Some mechanisms known as `schmuck insurance` are implemented to protect the VC if a down round happens. One example is called `broad-based weighted average antidiluion protection` and the other example is called `full ratchet`

1. Voting Rights
    * Voting Proxy
    * Dual-class structure

# Chapter 10: Term sheets: Governance
* **Keynotes**:
    * Who gets a say in what happens in a company.
    * Simplicity is better.
    * Always be forward thinking about what you agree to in the current term sheet, being mindful that it have implications for subsequent financings. 

1. Board of Directors
    * Three-person board: One for the common share holders, one for the Preferred share holders, one for the independently neural party.
    * Common-controlled boar: There are more board members representing the common shareholders than other classes of shareholders

1. Protective Provisions
    * Delaware law
    * Avoid smaller minority investors in later rounds have greater governance control than they have economic interests. One solution is to lump all the independent series of preferred stock together into a single voting class versus allowing each series of preferred control to have their own votes.
    * Instead of ask for a separate class vote for the investors, who join later but invest a lot of capital. An intermediate way of addressing the concern is to not provide a separate series vote for all corporate actions, but rather to enumerate a specific list of things that new investor is most concerned about for which she can have a separate class vote. Another way is to increase the voting threshold for required corporate actions to something greater than a simple majority. 
    * Protective provisions are designed to protect economic interests of the Preferred shareholders. 

1. Registration Rights
    * This is useful when a company goes public and the investor funds want to sell its shares in the public market

1. Pro Rate Investments
    * This section gives the VC the right, but not the obligation, to purchase its pro rate amount of future rounds of financing to avoid dilution. 
    * This seems like a fair thing for existing investors to have, but often it creates challenges in financing round. When the company does very well, there are more investors to come than the company cares to accommodate. 
    * VC wants to avoid: pick the right company to invest, but fail to own enough of the company.

1. Stock Restriction
    * Right of First Refusal (ROFR). This gives the company an opportunity to determine if they are comfortable with the third party before they approve the transaction., in which they will waive the ROFR.
    * The `co-sale` agreement. An inverse of ROFR. If a shareholder wants to sell his shares to a third party, all the other investors get a right to also sell their pro rata portion of shares to that buyer at the same price. 
    * These two terms are intended to make it harder for common shareholders, in particular the founders, to sell their shares. 
    * We all either succeed or fail together, but nobody jumps ship too early.
    * The common shareholders can not sell at all unless the noncommon board members approve it.

1. Drag Along
    * We tolerate democracy as long as a democratic process can not in fact affect the outcome. 

1. D & O Insurance
    * An insurance that VCs pay to make sure no money paid from their own pockets. 

1. Vesting

1. Employee and Consultant Agreement
    * Make sure that the company owns the technology free and clear and protect it.

1. No-shop
