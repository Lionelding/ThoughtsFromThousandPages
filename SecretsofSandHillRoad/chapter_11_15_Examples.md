# Chapter 11: The Deal Dilemma: Which Deal Is Better?
* **Keynotes**:
    * The right amount of money to raise in the current round is what you think you need to hit the required milestones for the next round. 

1. Would the extra funding enable you to achieve even more than you were originally anticipating the financing round. 

1. At a down-round, the weighted average formula is more friendly to the common shareholders than the full ratchet in terms of dilution.

1. It is simpler to have a capital "P" Preferred vote as the baseline precedent at an early stage versus setting up a series-specific vote this company's life cycle.

1. Don't underestimate the value of precedent. It establishes the starting point from which you need to negotiate. 


# Chapter 12: Board Members and The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval

1. Private versus Public Boards
    * First, the board members are typically elected byt the common shareholders in a public company. In private company, the board composition is generally dictated by the term negotiation in the course of a financing round.
    * Second, the impact of board decisions can also vary between public and private companies because of the protective provisions and VCs' preferred shares.
    * Finally, the presence of other terms (i.e. antidilution and liquidation preference) can also affect the decision-making process in a private startup.

1. Dual Fiduciaries
    * VC are the dual fiduciaries: As a board member to the common shareholders VS as a GP to the LPs

1. The role of the board
    * Hire/fire the CEO
    * Guidance on Long-Term Strategic Direction for the Business
    * Approving various corporate actions. 

        fair market value for stock in the employee option, 409A opinion.

        VCs are always keeping an eye on the amount of the vested VS unvested stock for founders.


    * Maintaining Compliance and Good Corporate Governance

    * VC-Specific Roles

        VC board member is to open her network to the benefit of the CEO.

    * The board's Non-Roles

        Good boards recognize this distinction; Bad boards overreach.

        Several things to manage the board indirectly. 
        
        First, set the right expectations. 
        
        Second, get an agreement with them as to how they provide you feedback.

        Third, ensure you and your board agree on engagement outside of a board meeting with members of your executive team. 

        Sitting down with your board members at the outset to solicit their feedback on what they would like to see part of the board agenda is a great way to avoid missing the marking during the board meeting. 

# Chapter 13: In Trados We Trust
* **Keynotes**:
    * Core Legal Duties for the Board Members. 

1. Duty of Care

1. Duty of Loyalty

1. Duty of Confidentiality 

1. Duty of Candor

There are the primary fiduciary duty of a board member optimized for the common shareholders. The board members don't own fiduciary duties to the preferred stock. The basic assumption is that the preferred can look out for themselves, but there is no way for the common shareholders.


1. The Business Judgement Rule (BJR)

    * The board act on an informed basis, in good faith. But the decision need not have ultimately been right. The courts will evaluate the `process`. Therefore, it is critical to keep good minutes of the meetings to reflect the frequency and the level of deliberations. 

    * Start the next board meeting by approving the minutes form the prior board meeting. 

1. Entire Fairness 
    * This changes the burden of proof in the case and give the court more latitude to look into the details of the business transaction. 
    * A few important facets

        First, when it comes to defending yourself in court, having the burden to prove your case is much more difficult than coming in with a presumption of fair dealing.

        Second, the court will dive into the detail of the decision-making process. The court will test the fairness of the process itself.The courts will next test the fairness of the price achieved by the board. (in the acquisition event)

    * A huge difference between violations of the duty of care VS the violations of the duty of loyalty is that directors can not indemnify themselves against the breaches of duty of loyalties. 

    * Lesson learned from the Case of Re Trados

        First, if you have executives who are representing the common shareholders on the board and get benefits from the deal that are material to them, and not otherwise shared with the rest of the common, there is pretty good presumption that they are conflicted.

        Second, calling someone an independent does not make them so. It is a good starting assumption that most VC-backed startups don't have independent boards.

        Third, it is easier to get to a fair process than to reply on getting to a fair price. 

        Fourth, utilizing a third party to get a fair price instead of the board itself. 

# Chapter 14: Difficult Financing: When Bad Things Happen to Good People
* **Keynotes**:
    * When things get tough:
    * Recapitalization
    * Bridge Financing
    * Convertible note

1. Reducing Liquidation Preferences
    * `pull-up`: Instead of wiping out 100 percent of a VC's liquidation preference, it can carry forward some portion of it as an inducement to invest in the new financing round. 
    * Convert VC's existing preferred shares into common shares.

If a down-round happens, it is more often lead by the existing VCs in the company. This also raised a lot of fiduciary duty questions. 

1. How to move forward after a down-round?
    * Give the the common shareholders at least a shot at earning some return on their equity.
    * Grants more share to the remaining employees.
    * Management Incentive Plan (MIP). Often implemented in recapitalization or down-round scenarios in which a near-term sale of the business is being contemplated. This means that the investors with liquidation preference agree to make some amount of the acquisition proceed available first to defined employees in the company, before they take their liquidation preference. 
    * Recapitalization as a fresh start for the business to try to execute on a stand-alone path, a MIP can actually create the wrong incentive. 
    * If looking for a IPO, then maximize the long-term equity incentives of everyone involved.
    * If looking for a short-term bridge to an acquisition, then MIP makes more sense. 

1. Winding Down
    * WARN Act. Intended to deal with mass layout. Sixty days' notice ahead before a shutdown.
    * `faltering company exception` in WARN liability
    * You can not keep employees working beyond the point at which you can pay payroll. Failing to do some would make officers and directors could have personal liability to pay these expenses. 
    * Accrued vacation. Becomes the liability of the company once the employees accrue vacations. 
    * Other expenses --> unsecured trade creditors in a wind-down situation.
    * One exception: when the company acts in bad faith with respect to these creditors
    * Order: Debt holders -> equity holders -> unsecured trade creditors

# Chapter 15: Exit Stage Left (The Good Kind)

* Keynotes:
    * Spend time understanding who you likely eventual acquirers might be and finding ways to engage with them.
    * When any of your potential acquirers decides it's time for them to think about making an acquisition in your space, you want to be on the list of potential candidates.

1. Acquisitions
    * More than 80 percent of exits are acquisition.
    * If there is a share exchange for acquisition, the board need to evaluate the buyer's shares.

        Set up `Collar`: an upper and lower limit bound of stock price movement. 

        Consider if the stock is freely tradable.

    * What happen to the employee options in the case of acquisition
        
        Scenario 1: The unvested options get assumed by the acquirer. 

        Scenario 2: The unvested options get canceled by the acquirer.

        Scenario 3: The unvested options get accelerated. Single trigger/Double trigger

    * Consider which employee of the acquired company are considered critical to the go-forward business

        The selling company wants to keep the required acceptance rate as low as possible, whereas the acquirer wants to get as many as possible of those whom it considers to be the key employee to come over. 
        
        The acquirer will create a closing condition. 

    * Voting approval. A higher threshold (i.e. 90%) required by acquirer. This is to reduce the potential legal risks.

    * Escrow account. 10-15% of the purchase price. 12-18 month post closing.

    * Indemnification. 

        A few areas to negotiate. First, which claims can be covered beyond the escrow account. If there is a limit on the recovery, is it capped by the purchase price of the acquisition. 

    * Exclusivity Period. The time between signing of the term sheet and closing of the transaction. 30-60 days.

    * Board Responsibilities

        `Revlon Duties`. The board has no obligation to sell the company. If the board decides to proceed down that path, it must seek to maximize the value of the common stock. Act in good faith. The board it not obligated in all cases to take the highest price. 

    * As a CEO, consider

        The organizational structure that acquirer is contemplating post acquisition: Will your team get folded intact into an existing organization, and/or will the team get distributed across various groups, and/or will the business be run as a separate entity?

        Reputation will be earned and remembered based upon how you treat departing employees.

1. IPO
    * Why to public

        Raise Capital.
        
        Branding.

        Liquidity.

        Customer credibility.

        M&A currency

    * Process

        1) Pick the investment banks, also known as underwriters/beauty contest/bake-off

            Consider the domain expertise of the banks in the industry.

            Consider their relationships with institutional investors who could buy the IPO.

            Consider the strength of the banks' sales and trading desks, which also creates an orderly trading environment in the first few weeks following the IPO.

            Consider their capabilities post-IPO to be able to help with M&A advice, follow-on financings and other capital market issues.

        2) Host kickoff meeting

        3) Draft the prospectus

            `Emerging growth company` (EGC). A company with less than 1 billion revenue in the most recent financial year. Easier to go public. Benefits of being EGC: Testing the water + Confidential filings + Financial and regulatory disclosures

            Set up initial filing price range and offering size. Breaking issue price


        4) Road show. One-hour pitch meetings to institutional investors

        5) Lockup agreement

        * A secondary offering of shares. A special sale to the existing institutional investors. The shares being sold are secondary. This gives the company an opportunity to place the shares in friendly institutional hands and thus minimize the negative price pressure on the stock. 

# Conclusion: The world is flat
* **Keynotes**:
    * Trend 1: Some VC not only fund startups in early stages, but also fund through their life cycles.

    * Trend 2: As companies stay private longer, more nontraditional (i.e. hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds) sources of growth capital entered the financing market, which focuses on the later-stage of the startups. The appreciation shifts from post-IPO to pre-IPO, at the expense of those in public markets.

    * Private capital is becoming a commodity. The access to capital alone no longer differentiates VCs.

1. Possible Futures
    * We are in fact simply the most advanced dinosaurs? The implication being that we may think we look differentiated relative to others, but we are always at risk of being the last generation in the evolutionary chain of traditional venture firms. 

    * Crowdfunding?

    * Initial Coin Offering?

    Each is way to democratize access to capital beyond the more centralized venture ecosystem that exists today
