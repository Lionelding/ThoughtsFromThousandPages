Entrepreneurs build business; VC's don't.

# Chapter 0: Introduction

# Chapter 1: Born in Bubble
Two significant transformations since 2000:
1. The amount of capital required to start a company began to decline

1. The advent of an incubator knowns as Y Combinator. Knowledge and view sharing across entrepreneurs, change the balance between entrepreneurs and VCs.  

Tech startups need to fit a market problem to a compelling market solution to have a shot at success.

# Chapter 2: So Really, What is Venture Capital
* **Keynotes**:

    * VS is a source of funding for companies that are not otherwise good candidates to get funding from other, more traditional financial institutions. 

1. A company that is generating excess cash flow may wish to return capital to its equity holders in the form of a dividend or a buyback of shares, but they are no requirements to do this. 

1. Equity financing VS Debt 
    
    If you can generate near-term cash flow, banking lending may be better. No need to sell any of the equity in a company. 
    
    If 1) no near-term ability to generate cash, 2) risky 3) long illiquidity, then equity financing is better. 

    It is the equity financing that investors are willing to hold on for a long time. 


1. Angel & Seed investors

    Convertible notes, in lieu of getting the principal back, the investor converts its debt into equity. 

1. Investors, The VC, and Entrepreneur

1. For VCs, failing to invest in a winner means that you forfeit all the asymmetric upside that comes along with that investments.

1. VC investing is a zero-sum game.

1. VC investing is undemocratic not only in the sense that the winners seem generally to just get richer, but also because a limited number of players are allowed to ultimately complete. 

1. VC firm strategy
    * First, Diversification is a bad strategy. In general, diversification is likely to push you toward the median/low-return section of the power-law curve and thus be dilutive to overall returns. 

    * Second, it is very hard for new firm to break into the industry. A chicken-and-egg problem.

    * 50% fails; 30% does averagely ; 20% is good

    **VC cares about frequency with which the VC gets a return of more than 10 times her investments.**

1. Some Stats:
    * Between 2014 and 2019, US VC investments in portfolio companies tended to be around 60-70 billon per year
    * In 2017, 19 billion (which is 25% of the total capital invested across all companies) went to a very small number of these greater than 1 billion valuation companies. 
    * In 2017, US VC firms raise about 33 billion from investors. 
    * In 2000, US VC firms raise about 100 billion from investors.
    * In 2017, the global buyout industry raised about 450 billion.
    * In 2017, the hedge fund industry manage more than 3 trillion. 
    * In 2017, the US GDP is around 17 trillion. 


# Chapter 3: How Do Early-stage VCs Decide Where to Invest
1. People and Team
    * Why you VS the others?
    * Many VCs delve deeply into the backgrounds of the founders for clues about their effectiveness in executing this particular idea. 
    * Every investment decision has infinite opportunity cost in that it likely prevents you as a VC from investing in a direct competitors in that space. 
    * How to evaluate a founding team: 

        Unique skill set, background, and experience. A real-world problem experienced by the founder becomes the inspiration to build a product. Founder had a unique experience that exposed her to the market problem in a way that provided unique insights into the solutions for the problem. Bringing a unconstrained view of the market could be a plus.

        Leadership abilities: if you create a compelling story around the company mission in order to attract engineers, executives, sales and marketing people. In the same vein, the founder has to be able to attract customers to buy the products, partners to help distribute the product and other VCs to fund the business beyond the initial round of financing. Explain it in a way that makes others to join the mission.

        Egomaniacal: an individual needed to be so confident in her abilities to succeed that she would border on being so self-absorbed as to be truly egomaniacal. 
    
    * Invest in good ideas that look like bad ideas. 

    * Most ideas are not proprietary, nor likely to determine success or failure in startup companies. Execution ultimately matters, and execution derives from a team's members being able to work in concert with one another toward a clearly articulately vision. 

1. Product
    * Will this product solve a fundamental need in the market (whether or not that need is known currently to customers) such that customers will pay real money to purchase it?

    * Evaluate founder's idea maze: How did she get to the current product idea, incorporating which insights and market data to help inform her opinions? It is the process of the idea maze that is the better predictor of the founder's success than the actual product idea itself.

1. Market Size
    * Market size, Market size, and Market size.

    * Market size estimation is easiest when a new product is positioned as a direct substitute for an existing product. 

    * Fortunes can be won or lost based on a VC's ability to understand market size and think creatively about the role of the technology in developing new markets. 

# Chapter 4: What Are LPs and Why Should You Care?
1. Types of LPs:
    * University Endowments
    * Foundations. (Foundations are required to pay out 5 percent of their funds each year in support of their mission. The long-term real returns need to exceed 5%.)
    * Corporate and state pensions funds
    * Family office
    * Sovereign wealth funds
    * Insurance companies
    * Funds of funds. (They are not permanent capitals)

1. Where LPs invest:
    * Growth Assets: 
    1) Public equities 
    2) Private equities 
    3) Hedge funds. 

    * Inflation Hedge:
    1) Real estate
    2) Commodities
    3) Natural resources

    * Deflationary Hedges
    1) Bonds
    2) Cash

1. Illiquid markets tend to have less efficiently priced assets. Thus, there is more opportunity for smart asset managers to capture above-market returns. 

1. VC firms need to either sell or take the companies in their portfolio public at some point in time in order to realize cash to provide to their LPs. 

1. Time. 
    Be aware of the time constraints ultimately imposed on the entrepreneurs. At some point of the company's life cycle, the VCs will push for an exit to generate liquidity. This depends on the fund life-cycle and how the rest of the companies in the funding are performing. 
    
    Consider how old the fund is from which you are receiving your investment. This is a perfectly fair question to ask the VC.

    Most venture funds have a ten-year life with tow or three one-year extension periods. 

    The later in a fund cycle your investment occurs, the greater the likelihood that the VC may also not have sufficient reserves to set aside for subsequent financing. 

    How: 
    1) Ask about the specific fund from which the VC is proposing to invest in your company. Most of funds are serially numbered with Roman numerals. 

    2) How well the overall firm has done over the years, and if they are likely to be able to raise new funds in the future as a result. 

    If you want to raise more capital in the future, you will want to assess the likelihood of the firm being able to raise its next fund.

# Chapter 5: The "Limited" Edition; How LPs Team Up with VCs.
1. Limited Partner:
    * LPs have limited governance over the affairs of the fund. LP is passive investors.
    
    * LPs enjoy the protection of limited liability from a legal perspective. In contrast, the GPs take on the all the liability if things go wrong. 

1. Pass-through entities. Partnerships don't pay taxes. 

1. Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) 

    Incentives drive behavior, and how a VC gets paid will affect how she interacts with you startup. 
    * Management Fee: 
        1) 2% annually. 
        2) Calling capital. Most of the capital will be called over the first three to four years of the partnership, since that is when the lion's share of the investing is likely being done by the GP. 
        3) No double-dipping. Paying a GP to sit on the board is very unusual. 

    * Carried Interest

    * Understanding Valuation Marks
        1) Last round valuation/waterfall

        2) Comparable company analysis. 

        3) Option pricing model

        These are marks instead of real money. 


    * clawback: GP overdistributes profits to herself.
    * Most LPAs have a provision that allows the GP to reinvest/recycle some portion of her interim winnings into other companies. 
    * 5% from GP + 95% from LP: Nothing sharpens the mind liken managing your own money alongside your LP's money. 
    * Capital generally first gets paid back in the same way that it came in.  
    * Hurdle rate: GP is not entitled to take her carried interest on the profit if the return rate is below a threshold
    * Preferred return

    Fund performance affect GP's willingness to invest additional money in your startup or her desire to seek an exit. 

1. Governance: Management of GP-LP relationship

    * Investment Domain. You want to understand if you fit into their investment domain.

    * Best ideas

    * Hard work, or suspension

1. Equity Partner Agreement: GP-GP relationship

    * Equity partner agreement spells out the economics of the partnership. Equal partnership VS. Multitiered partnerships 


# Chapter 6: Forming Your Startup

1. C Corp. 
    * Focuses on building long-term equity value in the business VS. distributing profits directly to shareholders. 
    * Double taxation problem: Profits are taxed first at the corporate level and a second time at the individual owner's level when paid out. 
    
    * Advantage 1: different classes of stocks are allowed.
    * Advantage 2: tax. Most GPs will avoid investing in pass-throughs as much as possible. 

1. Stock vesting.

    * Is 4 year really long enough?
    * "Ruling from the grave". To prevent this, make sure that board seats are conditioned upon continued service to the company as an employee, not simply granted to someone as a function of having been a co-founder. 

    * Transfer Restriction. Implement blanket transfer restrictions on stock sale from the founding of the company. This means the shareholders can not sell without some form of company consent. 

    * Right-of-First-Refusal (ROFT) agreement. If some wants to sell his stocks, the company has a right to match any offers received and effect the purchase. 

    * Acceleration of Vesting.
        Acceleration: Increase a founder's stock vesting beyond the point at which the time-based vesting would otherwise permit. 
        1) Single-trigger: The founder's stock is accelerated upon the closing of an M&A event.
        2) Double-trigger: Both the closing of the deal and the acquirer's decision not to retain the founder in the new entity are required for acceleration. 

1. Intellectual Property

    * Invention and Assignment Agreement
    * A clean room: no previous company-issued laptop, no download from your previous employer
    Careful planning up front can save a lot of headaches. 

1. Employee Option Pools

    Give option holder the right, but no obligation, to purchase the stock at a future date, at a specified price. The price is called exercise price. The act of buying the stock at the exercise price is called exercising the option. 

    Two types of stock options
    1) Incentive Stock option: Defer taxes until she sells the underlying taxes. Need to be exercised within 90 days after employee's leaving the company.

    2) Non-qualified options: Need to pay taxes at the time of exercise, regardless of the whether she chooses to hold the stock longer term. 
    
    One-year cliff vest. 

1. New normal for Longer IPOs
It takes more than 4-6 years to go public for most of companies. 

    * Cost too much money to go public
    * Efficiency Rules Disproportionately Affect Smaller Companies
    * Mutual Funds are bigger, and therefore like bigger companies. 
    * There are alternative forms of private financing out there. 
    * There are too much pressure on public companies these days.
